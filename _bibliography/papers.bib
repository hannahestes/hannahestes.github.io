  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Advancing Software Product Management Education: Insights from an Industry Survey},
  author={Hannah Estes, and Katie Hollowell, and John Cheek, and Shiv Patel, and Hanna Reese , and Kathryn T. Stolee},
  abstract={Software product managers have become critical to a software
            product's success. They act as a liaison among various stakeholders
            -- software engineers, management, and customers -- to ensure a
            product meets customer needs. Despite the role's rise in popularity,
            research and related educational materials are just emerging. In
            this paper, we aim to understand the educational needs of software
            product managers, and why embedding them in a software team
            is valuable. To do this, we collected survey responses from 59 software product managers and 63 software engineers, with responses
            from at least 24 companies, to identify the topics, skills, and abilities that software product managers find important for the role
            and the value they provide to software teams. Our results reveal
            that a software product manager's value stems from their ability
            to provide the team with direction and a plan, give context for
            decision-making, and effectively communicate across stakeholders.
            To support this, someone new to the role must have competencies
            in technical and non-technical areas. A software product manager
            must excel at interpersonal communication, understanding the technical atmosphere, and deriving product sense from a vision and
            strategy. This paper provides the groundwork for future software
            product management curricula by identifying 21 key competencies
            and 10 factors to describe the role's value in software teams.},
