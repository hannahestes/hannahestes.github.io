<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I’m a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at North Carolina State University, advised by [Dr. Kathryn T. Stolee](https://kstolee.github.io/) in the [Wolfpack Innovations Software Engineering Research (WISER) Lab](https://ncsu.software/).

My research focuses on the evolving role of the software product manager (SPM) in the software industry. So far, I’ve identified:

1. 21 _competencies_ to drive SPM curricula,
2. 10 reasons _why_ the role is valuable to software teams,
3. 8 primary _responsibilties_ of the role accompanied with 19 categories of _questions_ that SPMs should be capable of answering,
4. 8 typical _problems_ when working with SPMs.
